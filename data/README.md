# QoE open dataset using VLC indicators

This open dataset the  following data:

   - Subjective rattings.
   
   - MOS scores.
   
   
  To build this dataset, a testbed is achieved in the LiSSi laboratory (http://lab.lissi.fr/) around Paris city in France. 62 
testers prticipated in the test campaign. All of them were researchers and students from different disciplines aged 19 to 41 
years  with  few  or  no  experience  with video assessment experimentation. The collected QoE IFs concerns many video 
parameters that VLC video player provides as indicator.
