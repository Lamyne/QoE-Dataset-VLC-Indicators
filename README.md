# QoE-Dataset-VLC-Indicators

This work is proposed to describe and to share a subjective  QoE  dataset  that  assess  YouTube  video  quality in  controlled  
laboratory environment.  This  dataset  is collected  using  the  subjective  Absolute  Category  Rate  (ACR) method based
on Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratting score. It provides a good representative panel of various QoE Influence Factors (QoE IFs), 
that allows researchers community to  work in  order to  study  and  better understand  the QoE concept.

To build this dataset, a testbed is achieved in the LiSSi laboratory (http://lab.lissi.fr/) around Paris city in France. 62 
testers prticipated in the test campaign. All of them were researchers and students from different disciplines aged 19 to 41 
years  with  few  or  no  experience  with video assessment experimentation. The collected QoE IFs concerns many video 
parameters (QoA) that VLC video player provides as indicator.
